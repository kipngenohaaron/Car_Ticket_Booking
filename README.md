# Car Ticket Booking

Car Ticket Booking is a web application that allows users to book car tickets, make payments, and provide feedback. It provides a simple and convenient way for users to reserve seats in different car types and enjoy a hassle-free booking experience.

- Ability to select car type and specify the number of seats.
- Real-time calculation of the total amount based on the selected car type and number of seats.
- Secure login functionality for authenticated access.
- Payment integration to complete the ticket purchase process.
- Feedback submission to gather user input and improve the booking experience.
